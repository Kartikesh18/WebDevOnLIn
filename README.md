## Accessing the Projects

To access the projects, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:**
   - Go to the repository you want to work with on a platform like GitHub.
   - Click the "Fork" button to create a copy of the repository under your own GitHub account.

2. **Clone the Repository:**
   - Open your terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
   - Use the `git clone` command followed by the repository's URL to clone it to your local machine. For example:
     ```
     git clone https://github.com/kratikesh18/WebDev.git
     ```

3. **Open the Whole Folder with Live Server:**
   - Make sure you have a live server extension installed in your code editor (e.g., Live Server for Visual Studio Code).
   - Open your code editor and navigate to the cloned project folder.
   - Locate the main HTML file of the project. Typically, it's named `index.html`.
   - Right-click on the HTML file and choose the option to open it with the live server. This will start a local development server and automatically open the project in your browser.

By following these steps, you should be able to clone the repository and open the project using a live server, allowing you to view and interact with the frontend code. Keep in mind that if the project requires backend functionality, you may not see the complete functionality without running the backend server as well. In that case, you'll need to set up and run the backend separately.
